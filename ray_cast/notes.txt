Notes for ray cating:

Steps for the loop:
	1_find the angle for the first ray
	2_Loop for each ray.
	3_Get the horizontal intersection
	4_Get the vertical interception
	5_Calculate the distance
	6_Take the closest distance

1_find the angle for the first ray:

the ray angle depends on the player’s angle and the FOV
so if the player’s angle is “PI / 2 ” and the FOV is 60 the ray angle should be “(PI / 2) - FOV/2”
we going to begin with the most left angle and go ray by ray to cast all of them,
“p_x” and “p_y” refer to the player's position.

first ray = players angle (pi / 2) - (FOV / 2)

2_Looo for each ray

The player's field of view is 60 degrees.
We will expand it to fill the entire screen. that’s why we gonna cast (S_W ray).

Our increment will be equal to the sum of the current angle and the field of view divided by the S_W.

increment = (current angle + FOV) / Screen width
